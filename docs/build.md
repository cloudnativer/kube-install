# How to build it?
<br>

First, make sure the docker and git commands are installed locally.

<br>

Then, use the following command to download the code locally:

```
# git clone https://github.com/cloudnativer/kube-install.git
```

Enter `kube-install` directory, executing the `make` command:

```
# cd kube-install
# make
```

The above command will automatically complete the build operation. 
After building, there is a file named `kube-install` in the current directory. `kube-install` file is binary executable file, run the command `kube-install -help` and start the kubernetes journey.
